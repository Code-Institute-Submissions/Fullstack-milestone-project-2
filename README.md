Testing

The first test I conducted was making sure that allauth was functioning correctly allowing proper authentication systems. I tested this by running 'python3 harvalet/manage.py runserver' in the terminal window and in the url bar adding 'account/login at the end redirecting me to the server login page. Here I signed in using my superuser credentials and I was correctly redirected to an email verification page.
